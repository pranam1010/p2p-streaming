This project is a peer-to-peer (P2P) video streaming application built in C++ using OpenCV for video processing and sockets for network communication. It includes two main components: VideoSender, which captures video from a webcam and sends it over the network, and VideoReceiver, which receives the stream and displays it in real-time. The project uses CMake as the build system and is intended to be compiled and run using Visual Studio. The OpenCV 4.1.3 and Poco libraries are required for building and running the application. Source files include separate modules for sending, receiving, and a combined execution. The application is built by generating a Visual Studio solution using CMake and then compiling it via the IDE or command line. The sender is run by passing the receiverâ€™s IP and port, while the receiver listens on the specified port. The project folder contains both Debug and Release DLLs, so you may clean up unnecessary binaries depending on your build mode. This project was created by Pranam P Gowda from Sahyadri College as part of a C++ learning task and is meant for educational and demonstrative purposes.
